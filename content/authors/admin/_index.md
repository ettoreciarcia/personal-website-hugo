## About Me 👾

I am a **Cloud Engineer** with a strong passion for containers and container orchestration. My career began as a system administrator, transitioning to the cloud introduced me to **Kubernetes**, which quickly became a focal point of my expertise. For the past few years, I have been deeply engaged with the **CNCF ecosystem**, consistently integrating open-source tools into my work. I specialize in designing and implementing cloud architectures guided by **Infrastructure as Code principles**, always aiming for the highest levels of automation and reproducibility.

**Push your code to Git, I'll take care of the rest**
